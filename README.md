# React Native Web3.js Boilerplate

React Native Boilerplate for Web3.js

This project is a boilerplate for developing an Ethereum application with React Native.

To use Web3.js with React Native, you need to make a few changes in your project. For example, you have to use the **node-libs-browser** and **rn-nodeify** libraries to use some Javascript libraries such as **crypto** or **Web3.js**. I have prepared this boilerplate to quickly start to develop an Ethereum dapp.
